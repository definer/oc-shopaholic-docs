**"Symbol"** field is used to render currency symbol on your site (For example: "$").
**"Code"** field is used to render international currency code in meta tags (For example: "USD").

Example:
{% verbatim %}
```twig
<span itemprop="priceCurrency" content="{{ obOffer.currency_code }}">
    {{ obOffer.currency }}
</span>

Result:
<span itemprop="priceCurrency" content="USD">$</span>
```
{% endverbatim %}

You can change sorting of currencies by going to **Backend -> Settings -> Currencies -> Reorder records**
