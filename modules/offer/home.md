!> **Attention!**  Designing catalog structure is very important stage before development of our project.
It is very important at this stage to determine what will be product and what will be offer in your catalog.
You can find more information in [section](catalog-structure/catalog-structure.md).

## Backend

You can create and edit offers by going to **Backend -> Catalog -> Products -> Edit product -> "Trade offers" tab**

!> **Attention!** All offer prices must be set in default currency.

!> **Attention!** You can set **price format** in Backend -> Settings -> Application settings -> "Price format" tab

## Import

You can import offers from XML and CSV files.
You can use [events](modules/offer/event/event#event-list-offer), that allows you to extend import data.
 
> You can learn more about importing from [XML](import/import-from-xml/home.md#import-from-xml) and [CSV](import/import-from-csv/home.md#import-from-csv) files in [section](import/import-from-xml/home.md#import-from-xml).

#### Import from CSV

You can hide import buttons in "Basic settings".
Go to **Backend -> Settings -> Basic settings -> "Import" tab**

#### Import from XML

For big catalog, you can use queues to reduce server load during import.
You can enable queues in **"Application settings"**.
Go to **Backend -> Settings -> Application settings -> "Import" tab**
