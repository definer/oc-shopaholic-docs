## Introduction

You can give access to any custom model (for example "Article" model). This will give you opportunity to give access to paid content, such as an article in paid journal.

:User goes to checkout page;
:User adds coupon to cart;
:User fills in their contact details;
:User chooses payment method;
:User makes order;
if (Need redirect to payment gateway?) then (yes)
    :User goes to payment gateway;
    :User pays with using payment gateway;
else (no)
endif
:Redirecting user to "Thank You" page;
:Site sends mails to user and manager;
:Manager changes order status;
:User sees changes of order status
in his account or receiving emails;
if (Subscription access exist?) then (yes)
    :Renewal access;
